                                        <small>Kind Disclaimer. I'm not a writer but I'll try my best to create an idea of the reason I started African Asili.</small>
                                        <small>I have for the longest time, ever since getting an internet connection been a lover of documentaries. I am a science nerd and never
                                            did history in highschool but for some reason having consumed soo much western, European and Asian documentaries felt we had a
                                            great deficit of African historic documentaries. Worse yet told by the people themselves. It's been said before that Africa's greatest 
                                            downfall was never documenting her history in written records.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            It was once passed down from generations but to date greed ignorance and capitalism has broken that historic link we once had.
                                            It is now more clearer than ever that we are on the verge of losing our history for ever. We live in the digital age but having to depend
                                            on "others" to research and tell us about our history is..there's something wrong.<br>
                                            someone once said "the one who wins the war writes history books"<br>
                                            Why not capture that part of history that is hidden all over. Not only the bad but also the good. We have a lot of private collectors all
                                            over the world, including the European Museums, now this is not a plea to get the privately collected items back to Africa, most if not
                                            all African countries ~governments~ don't seem to have a need for the museums. We the people do, donate the items collected
                                            privately as digital records, anonymously if you need to and help us record our history collaboratively.</small>

                                <small>
                                    To collaboratively reconstruct the African Narrative.<br><br>

How will we go about this you ask?<br>
Everyone has a part to play, your grandparents being the very first source of this historic link. Our intention is to record this wealth
of history they have. Will it be about traditions, colonization, life in the earlier day, historical event records or plants? We want it all.<br><br>
                                </small>
                                <small>
                                    Institutions can contribute records from their archives, photos, journals and much more.
This will also serve as a drive for future generations. It's said that greed and corruption has been the biggest hurdle towards the 
growth of Africa as a continent, today will mark a day in the future as a historical event We will forever record it. Let your future 
generations learn about the greedy few who impeded the growth of the nation.

                                    This is probably the easiest part. The first and most important way you can help us is by documenting history. Have your parents,
grandparents and friends share the part of history they can get to. <br>
Visit your local museums and historical sites, document them and share them with us and the rest of the world. <br><br>

More to this you can help us grow the platform. Our codebase is open source and as such you can help find bugs, build features 
and the like. You don't have to be a techie to help us build this, you can give us feature requests. You can become a writer, an editor, 
a graphic designer and we've not scratched the surface. You have a skill or ability that can help us and we would really appreciate
getting that help. AfricanAsili is and will forever be community owned.
