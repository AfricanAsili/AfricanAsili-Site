# AFRICANASILI

## What is AfricanAsili about?
 To answer this, I'll start off by asking you a question..
 I'll make the assumption that you're probably standing right now in some spot in Africa
 Wouldn't you want to know the history of the specific space your standing in right now?

 Truth is Africa has a very rich history but we risk losing most of it if we don't rise up to document most of it
 Don't get me wrong this is not a project about race, anyone one whether black, white, purple or green can contribute
 We need all the help we can.

 The idea is to create a wealth of history by documenting all that we can especially from our grandparents.
 Knowledge was once shared orally and then education happened and we termed most of what was traditional as backwards and with that, we lost part of our definition. We've aped other cultures so much that we are on the brink of loosing ties to our ancestral history.

 We need your help to actualize this. Not only developers but also writers, graphic designers, videographers and more. We also need your grandparents to help us record their history before it's lost for good.

 My name is Wachira Nicholas Nduati, an avid documentary lover who for the longest time tried to ignore the itch to start this. I hope it works out.
